# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
Dataset Group & Noise Level ($\sigma$) & Naive Persistence MSE & Static MA (W=3) MSE & PSAMA (Ours) MSE \\ \hline
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 1 & 0.05 & 0.0436 & 0.0125 & \textbf{0.0023} \\ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 2 & 0.20 & 0.1063 & 0.0412 & \textbf{0.0398} \\ Sinusoidal Drift Group & 0.50 & 0.8023 & 0.3150 & \textbf{0.2795} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across synthetic time series groups and noise levels. PSAMA consistently outperforms both naive persistence and static moving averages.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The window update rule uses first-order absolute differences without normalization by local variance or volatility scale, making it sensitive to global noise magnitude changes.
  Action: Incorporate a self-scaling noise estimator (such as rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize the gradient volatility metric.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Evaluation is restricted strictly to synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes, leaving open questions about performance on empirical domains.
  Action: Add an empirical dataset evaluation (e.g., benchmark financial tick data or weather sensor streams).
- [MINOR] (novelty) Discussion of connection to classical adaptive filtering and variable-bandwidth kernel regression could be deepened to better highlight the specific novelty of phase-space gradient mapping.
  Action: Expand the related work section to explicitly contrast PSAMA's gradient-to-window mapping with variable-bandwidth local linear regression.

# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
Dataset Group & Noise Level ($\sigma$) & Naive Persistence MSE & Static MA (W=3) MSE & PSAMA (Ours) MSE \\ \hline
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 1 & 0.05 & 0.0436 & 0.0125 & \textbf{0.0023} \\ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 2 & 0.20 & 0.1063 & 0.0412 & \textbf{0.0398} \\ Sinusoidal Drift Group & 0.50 & 0.8023 & 0.3150 & \textbf{0.2795} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across synthetic time series groups and noise levels. PSAMA consistently outperforms both naive persistence and static moving averages.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

- [MINOR] (novelty) Discussion of connection to classical adaptive filtering and variable-bandwidth kernel regression could be deepened to better highlight the specific novelty of phase-space gradient mapping.
  Action: Expand the related work section to explicitly contrast PSAMA's gradient-to-window mapping with variable-bandwidth local linear regression.

  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output

# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
Dataset Group & Noise Level ($\sigma$) & Naive Persistence MSE & Static MA (W=3) MSE & PSAMA (Ours) MSE \\ \hline
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 1 & 0.05 & 0.0436 & 0.0125 & \textbf{0.0023} \\ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 2 & 0.20 & 0.1063 & 0.0412 & \textbf{0.0398} \\ Sinusoidal Drift Group & 0.50 & 0.8023 & 0.3150 & \textbf{0.2795} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across synthetic time series groups and noise levels. PSAMA consistently outperforms both naive persistence and static moving averages.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

feedback. Their findings should be the primary basis for your revisions.

type: dataset
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Dataset
id: art_ivh-fgU1dmIf
summary: >-
  This dataset artifact provides a comprehensive collection of 4 distinct time series benchmarks specifically engineered for
  rigorous phase-space adaptive moving average evaluation and algorithmic robustness testing. The collection includes stochastic
  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and noisy sinusoidal waveform streams characterized by varying noise-to-signal
  ratios, capturing diverse empirical dynamics such as volatility clustering, stochastic drift, and regime-switching behavior.
  All time series streams have been meticulously acquired, preprocessed, and standardized into a unified JSON schema containing
  structured sequence arrays, train/test split folds, sliding window regression instances, and complete metadata properties.
  This standardized dataset suite enables researchers and automated agents to systematically evaluate phase-space adaptive
  smoothing algorithms against benchmark baselines across multiple noise regimes, ensuring robust performance characterization
  before downstream publication and paper drafting.

type: experiment
title: Self-Normalized Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average
id: art_6BcnZbLy6O8W
summary: >-
  This experiment artifact implements and evaluates the Self-Normalized Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) method.
  By computing rolling median absolute deviation (MAD) normalized gradient volatility, PSAMA dynamically scales moving average
  window lengths to balance responsiveness during high-volatility regime shifts and smoothing during stochastic noise. We
  benchmark PSAMA against naive persistence, static MA(3), and unnormalized PSAMA across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences
  spanning Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise. Results demonstrate that self-normalized
  PSAMA provides robust, stable, and accurate trajectory forecasting.

type: evaluation
title: Normalized PSAMA Statistical Rigor and Error Analysis
id: art_ZjuxCBObQxKL
summary: >-
  We conduct an extensive and comprehensive evaluation of normalized predictive state adaptive moving average (PSAMA) against
  static 3-point moving averages and naive persistence across 5,880 rigorous trials of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes.
  Our evaluation protocol encompasses multiple error metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
  and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), complemented by rigorous Wilcoxon signed-rank paired statistical significance tests. The
  empirical findings robustly demonstrate that static baselines and naive persistence significantly outperform adaptive window
  scaling strategies in high-noise regimes, providing profound methodological insights into adaptive smoothing limitations
  under stochastic volatility.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

description: Academic paper writing guidance for AI research. Covers paper structure, figure placeholders, bibliography building with Semantic Scholar, and citation rules. Does NOT cover LaTeX compilation or figure file generation — see aii-paper-to-latex for that.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
