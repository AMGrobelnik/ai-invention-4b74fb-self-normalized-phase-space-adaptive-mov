<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise synthetic time series governed by stochastic dynamics, a locally adaptive sliding-window moving average
  whose window size dynamically scales with local gradient volatility outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value
  persistence forecasting by suppressing observation noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that an adaptive sliding-window moving average, scaled by local volatility, outperforms static 3-point moving
  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.
</todos><user_data>
User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_KZZ3JEauA8v3/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.
</user_data>

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right.

Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise synthetic time series governed by stochastic dynamics, a locally adaptive sliding-window moving average
  whose window size dynamically scales with local gradient volatility outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value
  persistence forecasting by suppressing observation noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that an adaptive sliding-window moving average, scaled by local volatility, outperforms static 3-point moving
  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.
</hypothesis>

  This comprehensive dataset artifact provides 1,000 synthetic time series sequences partitioned into 10 distinct groups,
  meticulously featuring Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and sine waves combined with additive Gaussian
  noise across 5 distinct noise-to-signal ratios. Each sequence contains input noisy series, clean ground truth trajectories,

title: Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting
summary: >-
  We thoroughly investigate whether dynamically adjusting moving average window sizes based on local gradient volatility improves
  forecasting accuracy over static 3-point moving averages and naive persistence on short Ornstein-Uhlenbeck synthetic time
  series. Our comprehensive evaluation across 100 rigorous trials compares the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of adaptive moving
  averages against static moving averages and naive persistence baselines. The empirical results indicate that static moving
  averages and naive persistence currently outperform simple adaptive window scaling due to high stochastic noise in the short
  time series regime, providing valuable insights into time series smoothing under volatile conditions.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
