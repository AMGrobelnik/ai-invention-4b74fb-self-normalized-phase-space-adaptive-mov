<role>
You are a very experienced and critical conference reviewer specialized in the domain of the work under review.
You have reviewed for top-tier venues in the relevant field. Your reviews are known for
being thorough, fair, and grounded in the actual state of the field.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise synthetic time series governed by stochastic dynamics, a locally adaptive sliding-window moving average
  whose window size dynamically scales with local gradient volatility outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value
  persistence forecasting by suppressing observation noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that an adaptive sliding-window moving average, scaled by local volatility, outperforms static 3-point moving
  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.

<review_context>
No experiments have been run yet — evaluate the hypothesis purely on its merits.
</review_context>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

```
Test whether a 3-point moving average beats a naive last-value forecast on a short synthetic series. Keep the investigation minimal.
