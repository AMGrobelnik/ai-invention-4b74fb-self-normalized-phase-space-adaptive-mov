<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations within the hypothesis bounds.
5. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
6. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
7. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next

Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting with Normalized Volatility
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise time series governed by stochastic dynamics or empirical sensing regimes, a locally adaptive sliding-window
  moving average whose window size dynamically scales with self-normalized local gradient volatility (via rolling median absolute
  deviation) outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value persistence forecasting by suppressing observation
  noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that an adaptive sliding-window moving average, scaled by local volatility, outperforms static 3-point moving
  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refines PSAMA hypothesis by incorporating self-normalized noise estimation and empirical domain evaluation.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Incorporated self-scaling noise estimation (rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize gradient volatility across varying
  global noise magnitudes as suggested by reviewer feedback.
- >-
  Expanded scope from purely synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes to include empirical domain evaluations
  (e.g., financial tick data and sensor streams).
- >-
  Deepened theoretical connection to variable-bandwidth kernel regression and phase-space mapping.

# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The window update rule uses first-order absolute differences without normalization by local variance or volatility scale, making it sensitive to global noise magnitude changes.
  Action: Incorporate a self-scaling noise estimator (such as rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize the gradient volatility metric.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Evaluation is restricted strictly to synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes, leaving open questions about performance on empirical domains.
  Action: Add an empirical dataset evaluation (e.g., benchmark financial tick data or weather sensor streams).
- [MINOR] (novelty) Discussion of connection to classical adaptive filtering and variable-bandwidth kernel regression could be deepened to better highlight the specific novelty of phase-space gradient mapping.
  Action: Expand the related work section to explicitly contrast PSAMA's gradient-to-window mapping with variable-bandwidth local linear regression.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations within the hypothesis bounds.
5. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
6. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
7. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next
</principles>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting with Normalized Volatility
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise time series governed by stochastic dynamics or empirical sensing regimes, a locally adaptive sliding-window
  moving average whose window size dynamically scales with self-normalized local gradient volatility (via rolling median absolute
  deviation) outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value persistence forecasting by suppressing observation
  noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that an adaptive sliding-window moving average, scaled by local volatility, outperforms static 3-point moving
  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refines PSAMA hypothesis by incorporating self-normalized noise estimation and empirical domain evaluation.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Incorporated self-scaling noise estimation (rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize gradient volatility across varying
  global noise magnitudes as suggested by reviewer feedback.
- >-
  Expanded scope from purely synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes to include empirical domain evaluations
  (e.g., financial tick data and sensor streams).

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

  We thoroughly investigate whether dynamically adjusting moving average window sizes based on local gradient volatility improves

# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
Dataset Group & Noise Level ($\sigma$) & Naive Persistence MSE & Static MA (W=3) MSE & PSAMA (Ours) MSE \\ \hline
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 1 & 0.05 & 0.0436 & 0.0125 & \textbf{0.0023} \\ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 2 & 0.20 & 0.1063 & 0.0412 & \textbf{0.0398} \\ Sinusoidal Drift Group & 0.50 & 0.8023 & 0.3150 & \textbf{0.2795} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across synthetic time series groups and noise levels. PSAMA consistently outperforms both naive persistence and static moving averages.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The window update rule uses first-order absolute differences without normalization by local variance or volatility scale, making it sensitive to global noise magnitude changes.
  Action: Incorporate a self-scaling noise estimator (such as rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize the gradient volatility metric.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Evaluation is restricted strictly to synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes, leaving open questions about performance on empirical domains.
  Action: Add an empirical dataset evaluation (e.g., benchmark financial tick data or weather sensor streams).
- [MINOR] (novelty) Discussion of connection to classical adaptive filtering and variable-bandwidth kernel regression could be deepened to better highlight the specific novelty of phase-space gradient mapping.
  Action: Expand the related work section to explicitly contrast PSAMA's gradient-to-window mapping with variable-bandwidth local linear regression.

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations within the hypothesis bounds.
5. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
6. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
7. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

kind: hypothesis
title: Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average Forecasting with Normalized Volatility
hypothesis: >-
  In short, high-noise time series governed by stochastic dynamics or empirical sensing regimes, a locally adaptive sliding-window
  moving average whose window size dynamically scales with self-normalized local gradient volatility (via rolling median absolute
  deviation) outperforms both static moving averages and naive last-value persistence forecasting by suppressing observation
  noise while preserving underlying trend inflection points.
motivation: >-
  Traditional time-series forecasting relies on fixed-window smoothing or naive persistence. On short, noisy synthetic series,
  fixed moving averages often introduce crippling phase lag, while naive persistence overfits to instantaneous noise. An adaptive
  approach bridges this gap by tuning smoothing intensity to local manifold geometry.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit distinguishable regimes of stochastic noise versus directional drift.
- >-
  Local gradient volatility serves as a reliable proxy for signal-to-noise ratio in low-sample regimes.
- >-
  Computational overhead of adaptive window selection remains negligible relative to direct forecasting.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate diverse short synthetic time series (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and sine waves with additive Gaussian noise).
  Implement a dynamic moving average estimator that adjusts window length (1 to 5 points) based on local volatility, and benchmark
  Mean Squared Error (MSE) against a static 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast.
success_criteria: >-
  The adaptive moving average achieves a statistically significant reduction in out-of-sample Mean Squared Error compared
  to both the static 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across varying noise-to-signal ratios.
related_works:
- >-
  Classical Box-Jenkins ARIMA models: Focus on stationary linear autoregression over long horizons, whereas our approach targets
  low-sample, non-stationary short series with dynamic adaptation.
- >-
  Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters): Utilizes fixed or optimized global smoothing parameters across the entire series rather
  than locally adaptive window sizing per time step.
inspiration: >-
  Borrowed principles from adaptive filtering in signal processing and local bandwidth selection in nonparametric kernel regression,
  transferring them to ultra-short time series forecasting.
terms:
- term: Naive Last-Value Forecast
  definition: >-
    A baseline forecasting method where the predicted value at t+1 equals the observed value at t.
- term: Phase-Space Velocity
  definition: >-
    The rate of change of a system's state vector in its reconstructed phase space, capturing local volatility.

  averages and naive last-value forecasts on short noisy time series.

  global noise magnitudes as suggested by reviewer feedback.
- >-

  (e.g., financial tick data and sensor streams).

# Introduction

Short, noisy time series arise frequently in real-world sensing, financial tick data, and environmental monitoring, where observational horizons are strictly limited and noise-to-signal ratios are exceptionally high. In these low-sample regimes, traditional forecasting paradigms face a severe trade-off between noise suppression and responsiveness [1]. Static moving averages smooth out high-frequency fluctuations but incur debilitating phase lag during sudden trend inflections [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]. Conversely, naive last-value persistence (random walk forecasting) attempts to track instantaneous changes but catastrophically overfits to observation noise [2].

While adaptive filtering and local bandwidth selection have been extensively studied in classical signal processing and nonparametric regression [3, 4], their application to ultra-short, non-stationary time series with stochastic noise remains underexplored. Existing autoregressive models (such as Box-Jenkins ARIMA) and exponential smoothing techniques rely on stationary assumptions or global parameter optimization over long historical horizons [5], rendering them ineffective when sample sizes are minimal and volatility shifts rapidly.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA). PSAMA evaluates local manifold geometry by computing gradient volatility across successive time steps, dynamically modulating the sliding-window length from 1 to 5 points. When gradient volatility is low (indicating a stable stationary regime), the window expands to maximize noise attenuation. Conversely, when gradient volatility spikes (signalling a directional drift or inflection point), the window contracts instantaneously to eliminate phase lag and preserve responsiveness.

[FIGURE:fig1]

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a phase-space adaptive moving average framework that maps local gradient volatility to dynamic window sizing for short time series forecasting.
- We conduct rigorous empirical evaluations across 1,000 synthetic time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], encompassing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes and noisy sine waves across multiple noise-to-signal ratios.
- We demonstrate that adaptive window modulation achieves robust performance gains over naive persistence and static baselines [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa], validating the effectiveness of manifold-guided local smoothing.

# Related Work

Time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical linear models. Box and Jenkins [5] established the foundational ARIMA framework, focusing on stationary autoregressive moving-average processes over extended observation horizons. Similarly, classical exponential smoothing methods (such as Holt-Winters) apply global smoothing weights across entire time series [6]. However, these global parameter models fail in ultra-short regimes where local volatility dominates.

Adaptive filtering techniques, pioneered by Widrow et al. [7] for signal processing, adjust filter coefficients dynamically based on error feedback. In nonparametric statistics, local likelihood and kernel regression methods (e.g., Tibshirani [8]) allow bandwidth to vary across input space. Our work bridges these signal processing and nonparametric principles, transferring local manifold adaptation to discrete-time forecasting under high observation noise.

# Methodology

Let a discrete time series be represented by $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ of length $n$. In ultra-short forecasting tasks, we seek to predict the subsequent value $x_{t+1}$ given observations up to time $t$.

## Naive Persistence and Static Moving Averages

The naive last-value forecast assumes no drift, predicting:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{naive}} = x_t$$
While unbiased in pure random walks, this baseline amplifies high-frequency noise. A static moving average smooths noise using a fixed window $W$:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{static}} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=0}^{W-1} x_{t-i}$$
While effective for noise suppression in stationary series, static averaging introduces a phase lag of approximately $\frac{W-1}{2}$ steps during directional changes [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu].

## Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA)

To overcome the fixed-window dilemma, PSAMA computes the local gradient volatility at time $t$ using first-order differences in reconstructed phase space:
$$g_t = |x_t - x_{t-1}|
$$
We map this gradient volatility $g_t$ to a dynamic window size $w_t$ bounded between $w_{\min} = 1$ and $w_{\max} = 5$ [ARTIFACT:art_YhwpecnScjnu]:
$$w_t = \max\left(w_{\min}, \min\left(w_{\max} - \lfloor g_t \cdot \alpha \rfloor, t\right)\right)
$$
where $\alpha = 2.0$ is a scaling sensitivity hyperparameter. The adaptive prediction is then computed over the dynamically scaled window:
$$\hat{x}_{t+1}^{\text{adaptive}} = \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{i=0}^{w_t-1} x_{t-i}
$$
When $g_t$ is large (high volatility/inflection), $w_t \to 1$, reducing the estimator to naive persistence and eliminating lag. When $g_t \to 0$ (stationary noise), $w_t \to 5$, maximizing noise reduction.

[FIGURE:fig2]

# Experiments and Results

## Experimental Setup

We generated a comprehensive synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 time series sequences [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], partitioned into distinct groups based on stochastic process type (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes and sinusoidal drift) and additive Gaussian noise levels ranging from $\sigma = 0.05$ to $\sigma = 0.50$.

We evaluated forecasting accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all time steps [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]:
$$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t} (x_t - \hat{x}_t)^2
$$

## Quantitative Performance

Table 1 summarizes the aggregate Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across baseline methods and PSAMA on representative synthetic groups.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
Dataset Group & Noise Level ($\sigma$) & Naive Persistence MSE & Static MA (W=3) MSE & PSAMA (Ours) MSE \\ \hline
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 1 & 0.05 & 0.0436 & 0.0125 & \textbf{0.0023} \\ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Group 2 & 0.20 & 0.1063 & 0.0412 & \textbf{0.0398} \\ Sinusoidal Drift Group & 0.50 & 0.8023 & 0.3150 & \textbf{0.2795} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison across synthetic time series groups and noise levels. PSAMA consistently outperforms both naive persistence and static moving averages.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

[FIGURE:fig3]

As detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3, PSAMA achieves superior forecast accuracy across all evaluated noise regimes. In low-noise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck series ($\sigma = 0.05$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.0023$, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to naive persistence ($0.0436$) [ARTIFACT:art_ORGYhyMO-tAa]. Under high-noise sinusoidal conditions ($\sigma = 0.50$), PSAMA achieves an MSE of $0.2795$, outperforming the static 3-point moving average ($0.3150$) by $11.3\%$.

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical results demonstrate that modulating moving average window sizes via local phase-space gradient volatility successfully bridges the gap between noise suppression and phase lag reduction. However, several limitations merit discussion:

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The scaling sensitivity $\alpha$ and window bounds $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$ require tuning based on the underlying stochastic process frequency.
2. **Extreme Outlier Vulnerability**: In extremely spiky regimes where observation noise dwarfs structural drift, instantaneous gradient spikes can collapse the window prematurely, mimicking naive persistence.
3. **Synthetic Generality**: While tested extensively across Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes [ARTIFACT:art_msjKIdFP3p0L], validation on empirical financial tick data and IoT sensor streams remains an important direction for future work.

# Conclusion

We introduced Phase-Space Adaptive Moving Average (PSAMA) forecasting, a lightweight method that dynamically scales sliding-window length based on local gradient volatility in reconstructed phase space. By adapting smoothing intensity to manifold geometry, PSAMA suppresses observation noise during stationary phases while preserving rapid response during trend inflections. Comprehensive evaluations across 1,000 synthetic trajectories confirm that PSAMA achieves statistically significant MSE reductions over static moving averages and naive persistence baselines, providing a robust, interpretable forecasting tool for low-sample, high-noise time series regimes.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The window update rule uses first-order absolute differences without normalization by local variance or volatility scale, making it sensitive to global noise magnitude changes.
  Action: Incorporate a self-scaling noise estimator (such as rolling median absolute deviation) to normalize the gradient volatility metric.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Evaluation is restricted strictly to synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and sinusoidal processes, leaving open questions about performance on empirical domains.
  Action: Add an empirical dataset evaluation (e.g., benchmark financial tick data or weather sensor streams).
- [MINOR] (novelty) Discussion of connection to classical adaptive filtering and variable-bandwidth kernel regression could be deepened to better highlight the specific novelty of phase-space gradient mapping.
  Action: Expand the related work section to explicitly contrast PSAMA's gradient-to-window mapping with variable-bandwidth local linear regression.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

   - id can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>
   - You CANNOT reference artifacts you are proposing in this strategy as dependencies (they all run in parallel)
   - Follow the dependency type rules (e.g., experiments require datasets)
   - If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use depends_on: []
